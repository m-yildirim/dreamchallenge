# challenge

This is a small project written as part of a job application.

The challenge was to automatically play 100+ games of rock paper scissors where one player plays randomly and the other one always plays rock.

The code published here firstly prompts the user to define how many games should be played (up to 10 million games are allowed) and then prints the results to the console.

# Starting the game

To start the program, you can either run the Main.kt file through a compatible IDE (preferably IntelliJ), or run `./gradlew build` in the root of the project and run the JAR-file created in ./bin/build.
